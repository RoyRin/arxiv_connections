cell produces a sharp event at a fixed phase during the sniff cycle in response
to a given odor; different cells have different phases. The olfactory bulb
response to an odor is thus a sequence of sharp events. Here, we show that
sharp event onset is biased toward certain phases of the ongoing gamma
frequency oscillation. Thus, the signature of an odor is a discrete sequence.
The fact that this sequence is relatively short suggests a new class of ""brute
force"" solutions to the problem of odor recognition: cortex may contain a small
number of modules, each forming a persistent snapshot of what occurs in a
certain gamma cycle. Towards the end of the sniff, the collection of these
snapshots forms a spatial pattern that could be recognized by standard
attractor-based network mechanisms. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
solution with simulations of simple network architectures having modules that
represent gamma-cycle specific information. Thus ""brute force"" solutions for
converting a discrete temporal sequence into a spatial pattern (chunking) are

stress shear thinning fluid (Carbopol- 980) is presented. The investigation of
the solid-fluid transition in a rheometric flow in the presence and in the ab-
sence of the wall slip reveals a coupling between the irreversible deformation
states and the wall slip phenomenon. Particularly, the presence of wall slip
nearly suppresses the scaling of the deformation power deficit associated to
the rheological hysteresis with the rate at which the material is forced. The
irreversible solid-fluid transition and the wall slip behaviour emerge in the
same range of the applied stresses and thus, the two phenomena appear to be
coupled to each other. In-situ measurements of the flow fields performed during
an increasing/decreasing stepped pressure ramp reveal three distinct flow
regimes: solid (pluglike), solid-fluid and fluid. The deformation power deficit
associated with the hysteresis observed during the increasing/decreasing
branches of the pressure ramps reveals a dependence on the rate at which the

Our numerical method combines a linear splitting scheme,\nspectral discretization, and exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta\napproximations. Applications to the solvation of single ions and a two-plate\nsystem demonstrate that our new phase-field implementation improves the\nprevious ones by achieving the localization of the system forces near the\nsolute-solvent interface and maintaining more robustly the desirable hyperbolic\ntangent profile for even larger interfacial width. This work provides a scheme\nto resolve the possible unphysical feature of negative values in the\nphase-field function found in the previous phase-field modeling (cf. H. Sun, et\nal. J. Chem.

in a novel set-up which constraints cell motion to a plane. After aggregation,
the amoebae collect into round ''pancake"" structures in which the cells rotate
around the center of the pancake. This vortex state persists for many hours and
we have explicitly verified that the motion is not due to rotating waves of
cAMP. To provide an alternative mechanism for the self-organization of the
Dictyostelium cells, we have developed a new model of the dynamics of
self-propelled deformable objects. In this model, we show that cohesive energy
between the cells, together with a coupling between the self-generated
propulsive force and the cell's configuration produces a self-organized vortex
state. The angular velocity profiles of the experiment and of the model are
qualitatively similar. The mechanism for self-organization reported here can

undercooled melt by simulation of a phase-field model which incorporates
thermal noise of microscopic origin. As a non-trivial quantitative test of this
model, we first show that the simulated fluctuation spectrum of a
one-dimensional interface in thermal equilibrium agrees with the exact
sharp-interface spectrum up to an irrelevant short-wavelength cutoff comparable
to the interface thickness. Simulations of dendritic growth are then carried
out in two dimensions to compute sidebranching characteristics

crucial readout of how the cluster processes chemotactic signal; both
amplification and adaptation will alter the behavior of cluster speed as a
function of size. We also show that, contrary to the assumptions of earlier
theories, collective guidance does not require persistent cell-cell contacts
and strong short range adhesion to function. If cell-cell adhesion is absent,
and the cluster cohesion is instead provided by a co-attraction mechanism, e.g.
chemotaxis toward a secreted molecule, collective guidance may still function.

elastic turbulence, realized by the flow of a polymer solution between two

theoretically studied in literature, and this analogy is exploited to explain
the statistical properties, the flow structure, and the scaling observed

experimentally and presented in this paper: (i) saturation of the rms of the

the elastic stress; (ii) large rms of the velocity gradients in the boundary
